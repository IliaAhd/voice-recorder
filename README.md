## Features and Functionality

### Audio Recording

The app uses **`react-audio-voice-recorder`** to access the microphone and record audio. The button triggers recording, and when recording finishes, the audio is stored for playback.

### Visualizing Audio

The **`react-audio-visualize`** library is used to create a waveform representation of the audio data. During the recording, you can see the audio's live waveform in real-time.

### Audio Playback

Once the audio is recorded, you can play it back using **`react-h5-audio-player`**, which provides an easy-to-use interface for audio controls (play, pause, stop).

### UI Design

The app’s design is responsive and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, allowing it to scale across different screen sizes.

### Notifications

**React Hot Toast** is integrated for showing simple, customizable notifications for different events, such as start, stop, and error messages during recording.
